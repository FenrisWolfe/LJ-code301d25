This day was about Functional programming

##I learned how to:
create an admin page so I can easily view the stats of my blog app.

utilized IIFEs in my code so that all of my function calls are executed on page load.

Learned the array methods .filter(), .map(), .reduce(), and .forEach() to transform my data into what I need it to be. And chained these methods together as needed.
