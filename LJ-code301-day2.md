Today was a fun exercise in how to make sure you put your links and nav functions in the correct order.  Our hamburger menu wasn't reacting with our mouseover until Joel figured out I had him put it on the wrong line. GREAT WORK Joel!  

I think I need to keep reminding myself that most errors aren't from a compiler not working right, but from little mistakes like placement of code in the WRONG order! Or missing syntax like semi-colons and knowing when to use a double or single quote..
