## Day two Journal

Pretty much gave up on doing comments, no one else is and I will just have to adjust.

LOVE THIS TEAM!
Learned more about GIT as well. Accidentally did work on master and discovered that I could STASH the work make the branch I SHOULD be on and then apply the stash to that branch without messing with anything on Master!  THANK YOU STACK OVERFLOW!  Lol!
