##Day Five Journal
More needs to be done concerning accessing DB in my opinion, also UX and UI needs much better interface such as hovers that tell a user what to do with certain areas in our app.  For example, our user would have no idea they need to click the ADD button before clicking the SEARCH button in order to get a return on the item they put into the search BOX. It's non-intuitive.  Given the amount of time allowed for development I believe we still could have achieved this goal.  
We missed this opportunity because we were looking at it entirely as devs and not end user consumers.
On plus side, if we do in fact continue with this app, it can become a very useful tool for MANY users going forward.
